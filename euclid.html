    <h1>Problem 5: Euclid</h1>
    <div id = "all">
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Euclid discovered an ingenious mechanism for solving the greatest
        common divisor between two numbers thousands of years ago. Your mission
        is to write a program that uses his algorithm to efficiently find
        the greatest common divisor (GCD).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Here is the basic version:
    </p>
    
    <pre><em>
Given two divisors (x and y)
If x is less than y, swap x and y
as long as y is not zero:
    find the remainder of x / y
    copy y to x
    copy the remainder to y
    
The last non-zero remainder will be the GCD
    </em></pre>    
    
    <h2>Input Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        Each line of input will consist of two integer divisors.
        They might or might not be largest integer first.
        The number of inputs is not known.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Please use "5in.txt" as the input file name.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Sample Input</h2>
    <pre>
54 24
1785 546
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Output Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        Every line of input should result in one line of output. The output
        will be the greatest common divisor of the inputs.  
    </p>
    
    <h2>Sample Output</h2>
    <pre>
