    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        The Fibbonacci sequence is a famous pattern in mathematics.  Each value
        in the sequence is the sum of the previous two values.  It begins like
        this:
    </p>
    
    <pre>
        0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
    </pre>
    
    <p>
        0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 1 is 2, 1 + 2 is 3, 2 + 3 is 5, and 3 + 5 is 8.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        All this is dandy, but what if you want an arbitrary Fibonacci
        number?  Let's say you want to find element 14 of the series, or
        element 24?  Your job is to write a program that does exactly that.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Note that Fibonacci numbers get big very quickly, so input will be
        designed so that no result will be longer than 10 digits of output.
        (This should fit comfortably within the unsigned long type of most
        languages.) If you are running into strange negative results, be
        sure you're using a large enough data type.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Input Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        Each line will consist of a single integer. That integer is the index
        of the Fibonacci number you want to return. Remember, computers begin
        counting at zero, so item 4 of the Fibonacci sequence is 3.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Sample Input</h2>
    <pre>
4
10
14
18
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Output Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        There will be one line of output for each line of input. The output line
        will be the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence. All outputs will be
        expressable as 64-bit long ints.
    </p>

    <h2>Sample Output</h2>
