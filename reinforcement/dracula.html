    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Dracula is attacking suburban Transylvania. People are hurrying to try and grab
        mirrors. Can you find the area of your mirror to see if it's big enough to
        reflect sunlight at Dracula? You grab your handy measuring tape to measure the
        area of your mirror, but your mirror is irregularly shaped! How do you know how
        big it is? The Trapezoid Rule is a method of estimating the area of an
        irregular shape given a set amount of measurements of the length across
        it at regular intervals. Given measurements A B C D E F, the formula
        is 1/2 times (A + 2B +2C +2D +2E +F).  In other words, double all the
        values except the first and last, and divide the total by 2.
