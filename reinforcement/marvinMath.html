    <h1>Marvin the Math Pirate</h1>
    <div id = "all">
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        You've discovered a treasure map.  About time, right?  The map is clearly marked,
        and on the back is a series of numbers.  You think these are probably coordinate
        pairs which mark exactly the sequence you should travel on the map.  Just as
        you're ready to start following the map, it is stolen by your evil nemesis.
        Because that's what evil nemesises do.  He starts following the
        coordinates on the back of the map, and is immediately caught in a large trap.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You get the map back and look at the numbers again. You notice some patterns:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The first number in each pair is larger than the second</li>
        <li>All the numbers are positive integers</li>
        <li>The list is signed "Marvin the Math Pirate"</li>
        </li>You know Marvin. He loves to add and subtract
            (which is something Math Pirates love to do.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        You've spotted the pattern: The values on the map aren't the coordinates.
        The first value of each pair is the SUM of the actual coordinates, and
        the second value is the DIFFERENCE.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Your nemisis is breaking free. You need to quickly write a program that
        will translate each sum and difference pair into the coordinate pair
        you'll need to find the treasure.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Input Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        Each line of input consists of a pair of integers separated by
        a space. There might be any number of lines of input.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Sample Input</h2>
    <pre>
45 5 
8 3 
12 0 
11 11 
44 5
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Output Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        There will be one line of output for each line of input.  The output
        line will be the coordinate pair or the phrase "no solution"
    </p>

    <h2>Sample Output</h2>
    <pre>
25 20
no solution
6 6
11 0
no solution
    </pre>
