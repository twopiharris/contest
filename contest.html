    <h1>Programming Contest Question Guidelines</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The IUPUI Computer Science department hosts an annual programming
        contest for area high school students.  The traditional programming
        contest is based on contests that have been run by the Association
        for Computing Machinery (ACM) since the beginning of programming
        instruction.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The general structure of the contest will be as follows:  Each team will
      consist of two members.  The team will be given 10 problems of varying
      difficulty levels to solve.  Each problem will expect input in a plain
      text file, and will produce output also in a plain text file. The students
      can work in C, C++, or Java to solve the problems (Python may be added
      as an option.) When a project is complete, the code will be submitted to
      an automated judging system.  The system will run the code against a
      pre-determined input file (which the students will not have access to)
      and the team's response will be compared to the pre-determined correct
      response.  The winning team will be the team with the most correct
      responses. If there is a tie, the team which turns in the projects more
      quickly will win.  If there is still a tie, code documentation and
      completeness will be taken into account to break ties.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Generating the Problems</h2>
    
    <p>
      Of course the key to running a successful contest is to have a good set
      of problems.  A programming problem should meet these criteria:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Be fair</strong> - All necessary information should
        be provided with the question. </li>
        <li><strong>Be unambiguous</strong> - Test input should guarantee the
        desired test output. </li>
        <li><strong>Be language-neutral</strong> - It must be possible for a
        skilled team to solve the problem in any of the indicated languages.</li>
        <li><strong>Use appropriate input and output</strong> Both the expected
        input and output formats should be clearly stated. </li>
        <li><strong>Be of reasonable difficulty</strong> - The best team should
        be able to barely finish ten projects in two hours.  Some problems 
        should be easy enough for any high school programmer to finish, and
        a few should separate the truly skilled programmers from the pack.</li>
        <li><strong>Be interesting</strong> It would be nice for the problems
        to reflect a wide range of interests and domains.  They shouldn't all
        be about math and engineering, for example. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Sample Problems</h2>
    <p>
        Since programming contests have been around for over 30 years, there is
        a rich heritage of programming problems already floating around.  It
        is completely fair to mine these existing problem sets for ideas.
        However, the top teams will have also examined these archives, so we
        shouldn't simply repeat existing problems. There shoud be some new
        twist or adaptation.  Here's a few places I've found some interesting
        problems online:
    </p>

        </a>These go back to 1974 - expecting punch card I/O!</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.karrels.org/Ed/ACM/">Ed's Archive</a>

            Math problems, but most are best solved with a program</li>

        <li><a href="http://www.spoj.com/">SPOJ</a>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>What to submit</h2>
    <p>
        Each problem will vary, of course, but in general the problems should have
        the following characteristics.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A Name</strong> - Give the problem a distinctive name we
        can use when talking about it.</li>
        <li><strong>Background Information</strong> - If the problem is about some
        sort of story (animal population in an ecology, for example) or a
        particular kind of information (imaginary numbers,) provide enough
        background information for the users to get around the problem. You can
        expect no math beyond high school algebra, so if you are referring to
        some math topic beyond that, be prepared to explain it.</li>
        <li><strong>A diagram</strong> - Some problems are much easier to explain
        with some sort of diagram. Even if you have trouble with the drawing,
        provide a diagram if it will help and we can clean it up. Not all
        problems need this.</li>
        <li><strong>Input Expectations</strong> - Be very clear what sort of input
        is expected.  All problems will expect plain text files for input, but
        the format needs to be clearly described.  Describe what type of data is
        on each line, how many elements on each line, and how the end of the
        data will be indicated.
        <li><strong>Sample Input</strong> - Provide a sample input file. This
        can be a separate file or can be embedded in the problem page. The sample
        input must follow the input expectations.
        <li><strong>Output Expectations</strong> - Describe exactly how the
        output should be formatted. Indicate what type of data is on each line,
        how many lines of output data there should be, and how many output elements
        (of which type) are expected on each line. </li>
        <li><strong>Sample Output</strong> - Provide the output file created by
        running the sample input through your test program. The output file must
        follow the conventions determined by output expectations</li>
        <li><strong>Your completion time and comments</strong> - You must try to solve any
        problem you submit.  Please indicate how long this project took you to
        complete, what language you used, and anything you learned along the way
        </li>
        <li><strong>Projected difficulty</strong> - The difficulty of each problem
        should be one of these broad categories:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reinforcement</strong> - Any high school programmer
            should be able to complete this project. Should require only
            basic programming concept knowledge and structures (no advanced
            data structures, recursion, OOP required)</li>
            <li><strong>Challenge</strong> - Talented programmers will complete
            this program, but beginners may struggle. The techniques used here
            should be those topics normally taught in high school programming
            courses: variables, arrays, functions, loops, and basic OOP.  Most
            high school programs do not teach data structures or algorithms, so
            these should not be a major component of these problems. Most of the
            later projects in CS 230 would be in this category.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced</strong>These projects are intended to identify
            students who have moved beyond the basic fundamentals.  These problems
            can use data structures (trees, linked lists) and algorithms
            (recursion, load-balancing) if needed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Format</h2>
    <p>
        The preferred format for the program submission is plain HTML (No CSS -
        standard XHTML Strict / HTML5) code.  That way we can combine the problems
        into a single web site and provide a common style. A problem prototype
        is provided <a href = "problemProto.html">here.</a> Please use a plain
        text editor to edit this page for each problem. Talk to Andy if you are
        unfamiliar with HTML syntax. It isn't difficult.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We will be designating a project webmaster who will collect the projects
        and make them available on a protected site.
