    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Leonardo Da Vinci was famous for many things, but one of his oddest quirks was
        writing backwards.  You have discovered some of Da Vinci's notebooks, but when
        you look at the mathematics, it seems all wrong.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        After some study, you realize that Da Vinci was encoding his arithmetic, perhaps
        to keep nosy rivals from replicating his experiments.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For every calculation, Da Vinci actually reverses the numbers, so 23 becomes 32,
        and 100 becomes 1.  (For this exercise, don't worry about leading zeros) He would
        then do the calculation and reverse the answer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Your job is to write a program that can read Da Vinci arithmetic and decypher it.
    </p>

            NOTE: I'm making the Da Vinci story up. There is no evidence he
            actually did this, but it makes a good story.

    <h2>Input Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        Each line of input will consist of two integers separated by a space.
        Reverse each integer and add the reversed numbers together.  Finally,
        reverse the sum and print it as output. The number of input lines is
        not known.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Sample Input</h2>

305 794
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Output Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        There will be one line of output for every line of input. Each line will
        be a single integer.
