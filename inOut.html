	<h1>Input and Output for Programming Contests</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Contest programming is slightly different than the kind
      of programming you likely did in class. The biggest issue
      is the way grading software works.  Rather than working
      interactively with the user, your programs will need to
      read in from standard input. This is actually pretty easy
      to do, but it will take some practice.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The best way to practice is with an online tool like
      <a href = "http://ideone.com">ideone.</a> or  
      <a href = "http://hackerrank.com">hackerRank.com</a> These tools use
      remote compilation just like the contest system, and also
      uses stdin and stdout just like the contest.  It's also
      available any time you're online, so learn how to use it
      rather than being dependant on an IDE.
    </p>
			
		<p>
			We present here several starter scripts for the languages
			supported by the contest.  Note that each code snippet
			reads stdin until it is finished, and then calls a
			process function passing that line as single string. You can
			put all your code in the process function. There is no need to 
                        modify anything but the process function / method. Feel free to 
                        copy and paste these code snippets so you can get started more 
                        quickly.  You do not need to use this code, but you cannot use
                        ordinary interactive input like you might have done in class. 
		</p>
  </div>

    <h2>C++</h2>
    <p>
      C++ uses cin. Note that cin is Null (false) if
      there is no input.  Also, if the getline is
      inside the loop, the last input will be empty.
      This is why you typically only process cin when
      you get a line.
    </p>
    <pre>
#include &lt;iostream>
using namespace std;

//prototype process function
void process(string);

int main() {
	string line;
	//keep reading as long as there's more input
	while(cin){
		getline(cin, line);
		//ignore last input, it will be null
		if(cin){
			//do whatever with the data
			process(line);
		} // end if
	} // end while
	return 0;
} // end main

void process(string line){
	//your code here
  cout &lt;&lt; line &lt;&lt; ", dude" &lt;&lt; endl;
}
    </pre>
  </div>
	
	<div>
		<h2>C</h2>
		<p>
			C string manipulation requires some care.  The getline
			function returns a line from the input, but it does a
			quiet memory allocation, requires a length, and returns
			the number of characters read.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The getline() function returns a -1 when it cannot find
			any input. Be sure to return 0 or your program will
			incorrectly report an error.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Since the line variable is dynamically allocated,
			you must free it to prevent a memory leak.
		</p>
		
		<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h>
#include &lt;stdlib.h>

void process(char* line){
	printf("%s, dude \n", line);
} // end process

int main(void) {
  char * line = NULL;
  size_t len = 0;
  size_t read;
  
  while ((read = getline(&line, &len, stdin)) != -1){
    //strip the trailing newline
  	line = strtok(line, "\n");
  	process(line);
  } // end while
	
  //line was quietly malloc-ed - it must be freed
  free(line);
  
  return(0);
} // end main

		</pre>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h2>Java</h2>
		<p>
			Java is very similar to how you've probably used it.
			The biggest issue with Java is the strict naming
			conventions. Please do NOT use a package (because
			that requires a special directory structure.)  Also,
                        You may call your class whatever you like, but do NOT use
                        the public modifier.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			It's better not to put too much code in main() in Java,
			because main is a static method and has some limitiations.
			In the sample code, the constructor reads each line of
			stdin and calls process() with that line as a parameter.
		</p>
		
		<pre>
/* package whatever; // don't place package name! */
 
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;
 
/* 
  DO NOT use the public modifier, but you may call the class whatever you wish.
*/
class Solution
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		//Don't write too much in main. Static methods are a pain
		//Just instantiate your class
		new Solution();
	}
 
	public Solution(){
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		while(input.hasNext()){
			String line = input.nextLine();
			process(line);
		} // end while
	} // end constructor
 
	public void process(String line){
		System.out.println(line + ", dude!");
	} // end process
} // end class def
		</pre>
	</div>

		<h2>Python</h2>
		<p>
			Python is (not surprisingly) very easy to work with when
			it comes to standard input.  sys.stdin is an iterator
			just like a file or list, so you can work with each line
			one at a time.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Note my process function is using python 3 syntax, but this
			code should work fine in any reasonably modern Python.
			You can use <code>print "%s, dude!", line</code> in
			Python 2.* if you prefer.
		</p>
		
		<pre>
import sys

def main():
	for line in sys.stdin:
		process(line.strip())
	
def process(line):
	print("{}, dude!".format(line))
	
if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
		</pre>
	</div>
