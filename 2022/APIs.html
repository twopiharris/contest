  <h1>API Treasure Hunt</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
  This year's programming contest will be a bit different.  We are doing a 
  hack-a-thon.  These are fun events that encourage you to learn new programming
  skills over time in a team.
  </p>

  <p>
  This year's theme is 'API Treasure Hunt.'  APIs are Application Programming 
  Interfaces.  In particular, there has been explosive growth of online APIs which
  produce data to use in other programs.  We have provided you a list of various 
  APIs you can explore.  Your challenge is to write a program that does something 
  interesting with the data you find online.  The options are nearly limitless, 
  with everything from weather forecasting to trivia questions. You ought to be
  able to find something interesting to write a program about.
  </p>

  <h2>How API programming works</h2>

  <p>
  The APIs we will explore are all based on web requests. For any of the databases,
  you can enter a query into an ordinary browser, and you will get a result.  
  for example, try <a href = "https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming?blacklistFlags=nsfw,religious,political,racist,sexist,explicit">
  clicking this link</a>.
  You will get a randomly-generated joke about programming.  When you look at the 
  <a href = "https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2">associated documentation</a>, you'll learn
  that you can change the various elements in the address to change what category, how
  many jokes you get, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
  The result usually comes back in a format called 'JSON.' (JavaScript Object Notation).  This 
  format is human-readable, and can also be read by most programming languages.
  </p>

  <p>
  Once you've chosen an API, you will write a program that can:
    <ul>
      <li>Ask the user for various parameters</li>
      <li>Generate an appropriate URL string</li>
      <li>Pass the string to the API</li>
      <li>Read the result string</li>
      <li>Process the data</li>
      <li>Print some kind of output</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Suggested APIS</h2>
  <p>
  Please begin by looking at the following APIs.  They have been selected from a larger list of 
  publicly available APIs, with the following criterion:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Interesting content</li>
    <li>No authentication tokens or logins are required</li>
    <li>High-school appropriate content</li>
    <li>All data is free and open</li>
    <li>The difficulty level seems appropriate to the contest</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>NOTE</strong>
     You might want to consider using the FireFox web browser when looking at the raw JSON, 
     because it automatically formats JSON text, making it a lot easier to understand and
     examine.
  </p>

  <h2>Technology Resources</h2>
  
  <p>
  You should be able to do this project in any programming language you might already know.
  The easiest languages to do API work in are JavaScript and Python, but we will assist you
  with other languages.  The language needs to support some sort of URL request (most do, but 
  you might need to install a library.)  You will also need to either have support for JSON
  objects, or be willing to parse the result JSON by hand.  For example, Java does not have 
  a built-in JSON library, but you can either add one, or use the String manipulation tools
  in the language to present an output.
  </p>

  <p>
  You should be able to use <a href = "replit.com">replit</a> or <a href = "pythonanywhere.com">
  PythonAnywhere</a> for hosting your program, so you will not need to install any programs on
  a school computer or your home machine.
  </p>

  <h2>Sample Code</h2>
  <p>
  To get you started, we'll look at the <a href = "http://time.jsontest.com">jsontest</a> API.
  This is a simple API that returns a time stamp.  Note that the time is relative to the server
  which seems to be somewhere in Europe, but that doesn't really matter. We're just looking for
  an easy API to practice with.  Here is how to connect to that server in the most commonly used
  languages:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Python</strong> - <a href = "APItest.py">APItest.py</a>
      If you can use it, Python is one of the easiest languages for this
      project, as it already has strong support for reading a remote URL and parsing to JSON.  If
      you use Python, the requests library is strongly recommended. It is already installed on 
      pythonAnywhere, but you might need to install it in another setting.  Note also that 
      PythonAnywhere has a whitelist of sites you can go to.  While most of the APIs are on that
      whitelist, it is possible you may not be able to get data from every source.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> <a href = "APItest.html">APItest.html</a>
      JavaScript / HTML also makes it quite easy to query an API and work with the resulting data.
      (after all, the JS in JSON stands for JavaScript.) It's particularly easy if you use the 
      jQuery module as described in the sample project.  The javaScript solution works anywhere, 
      and is particularly easy if you want to work with images.  You will also need to know a bit
      of HTML and CSS to make this work well.</li>
    <li><strong>Java</strong> <a href = "APItest.java">APItest.java</a>
      Java is a powerful language, but native support for this kind of work is a bit clunky.  The
      example file has a function you can re-use to read a JSON file from any URL, and this function
      works with off-the-shelf Java.  However, there is not a built-in JSON parser in Java.  So
      for this example, I used an external library from Google called 
      <a href = "gson-2.8.9.jar">GSON</a>.  
      You will need to know
      how to add a library to your IDE or how to compile with an external Jar file (I have included
      a makefile for unix, and your coach should be able to help you modify that as needed.) For the
      GSON approach to work, you need to analyze the shape of the incoming JSON string and build a 
      custom class to accept the data.  It is tedious, but the resulting class can also have custom
      methods and attributes, making it quite powerful.  (Welcome to Java.)</li>
    <li><strong>Other languages</strong> 
      Most high school programs are using one of the three mentioned languages.  If you are learning
      in another language (say C# or VB) contact your coach, and we'll see if we can put
      together a prototype you can work from.  This project will be more difficult in C or C++, as 
      they really don't have built-in networking, but we can help you if that's the language you
      want to work in.  Note that in the scorekeeping, we will take into account the difficulty of 
      the language you are using.  </li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Coaches</h2>
  <p>
  Since this is a new topic for many programmers, each team will be assigned an IUPUI student to
  serve as the team coach.  This coach will be available via zoom to help with the project 
  design and implementation. You will still need to write the code entirely on your own, but 
  the coach is there to help you learn new things you might not know how to do yet.
  </p>

  <h2>Scoring and Presentation</h2>
  <p>
  You will have at least a month to work on your project, with consultation from your coach and 
  your high school teacher.  You will submit your final project about a week before the CS day
  event, and we will score the projects before the event.  You may be asked to prepare a presentation
  of your project, so you should assume that you'll need a two-minute quick overview of what your
  project does and how it works. 
  </p>

  <p>
  The scoring rubric will be released before the formal start of the competition, but will likely 
  involve at least these components:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>creativity</strong> - What clever thing did you do with the data set? What problem
        did you solve, or what fun tool did you make?  How much of your team personality shines
        through the project?</li>
    <li><strong>documentation</strong> - How good is your planning and final documentation? Did you clearly 
        delineate what you were trying to accomplish?  Did you set up a reasonable schedule with 
        clearly-marked milestones?  Did you explain how to use the program?</li>
    <li><strong>coding style</strong> - Did you use a strong coding style? Did you comment well?
        Did you use sensible variable and function names? Did you use accepted programming practices?</li>
    <li><strong>complexity</strong> - Did you try to tackle a very simple problem with few parameters?
        Or did you add a substantial amount of features to make the program more flexible and usable?
        If you used a language without a lot of built-in features, how did you get it to work?</li>
    <li><strong>professionalism</strong> - Does the program work well without flaws and hiccups? Is it
        easy for users to learn and use?</li>
    <li><strong>aesthetics</strong> - You can use whatever type of user interface you want - command line
        with menus, standalone application, web site.  But did you think carefully through these choices
        and use your chosen UI type to enhance the user experience?</li> 
    <li><strong>presentation</strong> - Did you have a solid presentation that confidently shows the 
        features of your program?  Did you explain it well? Did you present well?</li>
  </ul>
