  <h1>Game Dev Contest</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>
  This year's programming contest will be a bit different. We are doing a
  hack-a-thon.  These are fun events that encourage you to learn new programming
  skills over time in a team.
  </p>

  <p>
  We will have a game programming theme this year.  To keep things fair, we
  will allow games in two formats:  Scratch (the well-known tool from MIT)
  and Twine, a free tool for building choose-your-own text adventures. Your
  challenge is to build an original game using one of these tools. 
  </p>

  <h2>Overview of Scratch</h2>

  <p>
  <a href = "http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> is a powerful tool for 
  exploring many programming concepts.  You can write your game entirely on
  the web, and you will use many of the tools of modern programming without
  the need to type code in. While Scratch is often used with young children,
  it is a quite capable game engine in its own right, and is ideal for 
  exploring 2D games with real-time interaction.  It's great for arcade-style 
  games, and has been used to build all kinds of very interesting games.
  </p>

  <h2>Scratch videos</h2>
  <p>
  Here's a video course on building games in Scratch --- from scratch!

  </ul>  
  

  <h2>Twine</h2>

  <p>
  The other option for the game contest this year is an amazing tool called
  <a href = "http://twinery.org">twine</a>.  This is a different kind of game
  engine, designed for writing a different kind of game.  Twine is all about
  'choose your own adventure' style games.  At its most basic, you can create
  nodes which allow you to build very complex games with many choices, using
  very little programming.  Once you get your game going, you can use a 
  scripting language called Harlowe to change how your game looks, and add
  interactivity like inventory and combat systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Twine course</h2>

  <p>
  Here is a set of examples and videos that walks you through Twine from the
  very basics all the way to building a sophisticated game with custom 
  programming:

  </ul>

  <h2>Coaches</h2>
  <p>
  Since this is a new topic for many programmers, each team will be assigned an IUPUI student to serve 
  as the team coach. This coach will be available via zoom to help with the project design and 
  implementation. You will still need to write the code entirely on your own, but the coach is there to 
  help you learn new things you might not know how to do yet.
  </p>

  <h2>Scoring and Presentation</h2>
  <p>
  You will have at least a month to work on your project, with consultation from your coach and your 
  high school teacher. You will submit your final project about a week before the CS day event, and we 
  will score the projects before the event. You may be asked to prepare a presentation of your project, 
  so you should assume that you'll need a two-minute quick overview of what your project does 
  and how it works.
  </p>

  <p>
  The scoring rubric will be released before the formal start of the competition, but will likely involve 
  at least these components:
  </p>


  <ul>
    <li><strong>Creativity</strong> 
        - What clever game idea did you come up with? How did you play around with a new mechanic or concept?
	How interesting is your topic and presentation?</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation</strong> - How good is your planning and final documentation? Did you clearly
        delineate what you were trying to accomplish? Did you set up a reasonable schedule with clearly-marked
	milestones? Did you explain to the user how to play the game?</li>
    <li><strong>Coding Style</strong> - Did you use a strong coding style? did you name things well? Did you
        incorporate comments as allowed by your engine? Did you use appropriate indentation and code layout? 
	Did you break complex concepts into simpler ones?</li>
    <li><strong>Complexity</strong> - Did you stick with safe but simple, or did you push the limits of the 
        tool?  How much effort did you put into creating interesting and new mechanics or features? </li>
    <li><strong>Professionalism</strong> - Does the program work well without flaws and hiccups?  Is it 
        easy for the player to get started with?</li>
    <li><strong>Aesthetics</strong> - Did you build custom graphics and sound effects? Did you try to use
        animation? Does your game have a sense of style and atmosphere adding to the gameplay?</li>
    <li><strong>Presentation</strong> - Did you have a solid presentation that confidently shows the features
        of your game?  Did you present well?</li>
