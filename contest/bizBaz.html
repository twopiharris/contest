    <h1>Problem 3: BizBaz</h1>
    <div id = "all">
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
    You are protecting Earth (again) from angry aliens bent on destruction of our
    planet.  The aliens have a special form of weapon that sends death beams in a
    wide swath of frequencies.  Our scientists have built a number of energy shields.
    Unfortunately, each shield only works on certain frequencies. For example,
    the "Biz" shield protects any frequency that is a multiple of 2, so it protects
    against death beams of frequency 2, 4, and 10, but not 3, 5, or 13.  Here are the
    shields at your disposal with their frequencies:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Biz: 2</li>
        <li>Baz: 3</li>
        <li>Buzz: 5</li>
        <li>Boz: 7</li>
        <li>Beez: 11</li>
        <li>Bizzle: 13</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    The aliens will send a number of attacks. Each attack is indicated by a frequency
    value. Your job is to coordinate our defenses by describing which shield to activate.
    Note that a certain frequency might require more than one defense. So, an attack
    with a frequency of 2 will call for "Biz," but a frequency of 6 will need "Biz Baz,"
    because 6 contains components of 2 and 3. 26 would be "Biz Bizzle."  Note you should
    count a shield only once, so 4 would be "Biz," not "Biz Biz."
    </p>
    
    <p>
    It's possible that an attack might leak through our defences. In that case,
    the output should be "Bummer"  This will only happen if NONE of the other shields
    can be activated on a frequency, so 34 is "Biz," not "Bummer"  
    </p>
    
    <h2>Input Expectations</h2>
    <p>
    The input file contains a single integer on each line.  The number of
    lines is unknown.
    Please name your input file "3in.txt"
    </p>
    
    <h2>Sample Input</h2>
    <pre>
14
33
17
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Output Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        Output will contain the same number of lines as input. Each
        output line includes the original integer and a string determining which defence
        or defenses need to be activated to protect against this attack.  There should be
        a space between shield names, and the capitalization should be preserved.
        A sheild name only needs to be listed once per line. If
        an attack leaks through, only the input and the term "Bummer" should be output.        
    </p>

    <h2>Sample Output</h2>
    <pre>
14 Biz Boz
33 Baz Beez
17 Bummer
