    <h1>Problem 7: Lisp Lite</h1>
    <div id = "all">
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        For this contest, you are most likely programming in an imperative langauge.
        However, there are several other completely different styles of languages.
        One of the oldest and most important is called 'functional languages.'
        Of these, a very old language called 'LISP' is probably the most important.
        LISP is a list-processing language.  In LISP, everything is a list.
        What would be considered a command in another language is simply a list in LISP.
        Often the first element in a list is some sort of instruction.  For example, to
        add two elements in LISP, you might say something like this:
        (+ 1 2)
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This will add one and two, resulting in 3.  You can nest instructions inside
        each other, so you can have more complex instructions like this:
    </p>
    
    <pre>
(+ (* 2 5) (- 15 10))
    </pre>
    
    <p>
        Inner lists evaluate first, so this expression would evaluate as (+ 10 5), and
        then 15.
    </p>        
        Your job is to build a simple lisp-style interpreter with the following
        limitations:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>You will have only four arithmetic operations: "+", "-", "*", "/".</li>
        <li>Each instruction list will contain three elements.</li>
        <li>The first will be an operation stored as a single character string.</li>
        <li>The second and third element will be an operand.</li>
        <li>Operands will either be integers or a list containing a new instruction.</li>
        <li>You will not know how deeply the instructions are nested.</li>
        <li>You can assume none of the input will lead to division by zero.</li>
        <li>You can also assume there are no syntax errors in the input lines.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Input Expectations</h2>

    <p>
        Each line of input will be one expression in pseudo-lisp.
        Note that every token (including parentheses) will be followed by a space for
        easier parsing.  There may be any number of input lines.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Please use "7in.txt" as the input file name.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Sample Input</h2>
    <pre>
( + 8 ( * ( - 5 3 ) ( / 10 2 ) ) )
( + 5 ( * 3 5 ) )
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Output Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        Each line of input will generate a corresponding line of output. The
        output for each expression will be a single number. (Don't worry about
        whether the output is an integer or a float, as long as it is accurate.)
    </p>
    
    <h2>Sample Output</h2>
    <pre>
18
20
    </pre>
